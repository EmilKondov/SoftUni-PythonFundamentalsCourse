1. Read/Receive the number of people waiting - I will use comprehension to get a integer list
2. Read cabins current state from the console
3. Iterate over every cabin and put as much people as possible in it. (max is 4)
    - Find free spaces in cabin (MAX size - current state of cabin)
    - fill the cabin
    - Decrease the queu of waiting people
    - Check if there are no more people or cabins.
